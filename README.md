## What is this package?

This package is supposed to **grow over time** as more and more projects are going to be developed
at **MonoCircuit**. Everything that is common among these and other projects (since this project is
**open source**) will be put in here.

It is important to note that **this is not a full time** project. It just serves as a _common
codebase_ for lines that have the <u>high potential</u> to be rewritten very often.

## What does it contain?

### Data Structures

-   🔘 `Node`
-   🔗 `LinkedList`
-   📚 `Stack`
-   🐍 `Queue`

### Others

-   ⚖️ `Comparator`

## Further Information

Some of the code might be spliced from other repositories like
[trekhleb/javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms), which is a
great source for all kinds of data structures and algorithms.

That is why here is a hopefully full list of sources that were used to create this repository:
